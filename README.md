# Sound_Tech-Projects
<h3> Sound Technology - Signal Processing using Matlab Routines</h3> <br>
<br>
In this course -roughly translated- "Technology of Sound" Matlab is used to solve various problems<br>
involving signal processing methods as their basis (e.g Short-Time Fourier Transform). Three individual projects are implemented. <br>
