# Sound_Tech-Projects
<h3> Sound Technology - Signal Processing using Matlab Routines</h3> <br>
<br>
In this course -roughly translated- "Technology of Sound" Matlab is used to solve various problems<br>
involving signal processing methods as their basis (e.g Short-Time Fourier Transform). Three individual projects are implemented. <br>
<br>
<h5>1st Project</h5>
<ins>Part 1</ins>: Using STFT we deconstruct a signal and analyse it in N-frames in the frequency domain. Then we reconstruct it <br>
with the inverse procedure to showcase the STFT accuracy and how it actually works. <br>
<ins>Part 2</ins>: Detect the onset of individual notes that are played in a sound clip based on the energy(magnitude) of the FFT that is shown <br>
in the time domain or the phase or the combination of the two. <br>
<ins>Part 3</ins>: Based on part 2, find the bpm (rhythm) of the sound clip. Obviously this implementation works on songs-sound clips <br>
where a musical instrument-sound works as a metronome, meaning that its onsets are prominent and rhythmically steady.
